## Plan for today

- Using the RStudio server
- Introduction to Git and GitHub
- Installation of R, RStudio, and `quanteda`
- Working with a basic assignment

<!--
## Accessing and using RStudio server

You should try accessing this server:

[https://me314.hpccloud.lse.ac.uk](https://me314.hpccloud.lse.ac.uk)
-->

## Gitting to know (git)

- Git is a distributed version control system (VCS)
- Git was written to manage the source code of the Linux kernel
- __Luckily, we will only need a small subset of the available commands__
- Those commands will allow you to:
    1. Download (`clone` and then `pull`) assignments from a centralized place (`repository` or `repo`) hosted at GitHub
    2. "Stage" your changes to the repository
    3. "Commit" your changes to your (local) repository

## Gitting to know (git) continued

- Note that you will not be able to push your committed changes back to the original repository, because you will not have permissions to do this.  
- More advanced users might choose to fork the repo and set an upstream remote to fetch changes.  See [this resource](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for details (entirely optional!)

## Installing git

- First you need the `git` software itself. Download it from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.
- Now you have two ways to actually use git to do stuff for you:
    1. Use a graphical client which works on top of the `git` software and generates a nice looking interface. We will install RStudio which contains a basic Git client.
    2. Use the command line, e.g. `git clone ...`.

## Install R and RStudio

- Install R from <https://cran.rstudio.com>
- Install RStudio from <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>

__If you already have R and RStudio installed, make sure that you have current versions:__

- R: >= __4.1__ (ideally
- RStudio: No reason not to get the latest

## Install required R packages

- Open RStudio
- Any packages you need, for instance `ISLR`, you can install using RStudio's built-in R package manager in the "Packages" pane

## Start using Git

- RStudio implements a Git client that we will use to download, or `clone` in git-speak, each assignment
- To use it, you first need the URL of the central location, or `repository`.
- Head to the first assignment <https://github.com/lse-me314/assignment01> and click on the green button `Clone or download`
- Copy the URL in the pop-up
- Go back to RStudio and choose "File" > "New Project..." > "Version Control"
- Then choose "Git" and paste the URL in the appropriate field and change the folder as needed
- Hit "Create Project"
- Congratulations, you cloned your first Git repo!

## Frequent issues

- In Windows, if RStudio cannot find Git, go to Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN and select the right Git executable. You may also need to add this route to your system Path (go to advanced settings)
- If two-factor authentication is activated in GitHub, you'll need to create a temporary token in Settings > Developer > Personal access token.
- If GitHub does not have your name or email, you'll need to add those using the Terminal in RStudio. Follow the instructions in the error message you get.
